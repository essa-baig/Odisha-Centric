# Odisha-Centric

We aim to help modernise Odisha's agriculture sector by providing accurate information and easy communication with field officials.

**About the project ->**
This site acts as an information portal for the agriculture sector of Odisha. It contains information about current and new technologies used in farming, the various climate conditions and soil and topography variation across odisha. The website has a simple design and is very intuitive and user friendly. This website also contains accurate and up to date content. Users can subscribe to our newsletter to get quick updates on their email.

**How we built it ->**
We used css, html and javascript. The entire project was coded on both vscode and adobe dreamweaver while collaborating via google meets all within 24 hours.

**Challenges we ran into ->**
We had many errors in code and the fact that our teammates had network issues at the most important discussion times certainly made the whole experience very adrenaaline-rich. Errors with github, editing and uploading the video to youtube and network issues for 2 of our teammembers 15 mins before deadline gave us all goosebumps. We learnt a lot within these 24 hours and thoroughly enjoyed the experience

**Accomplishments ->**
We are proud of successsfully completing and submitting our project within the deadline despite all the hurdles we faced. We truly believe this project to be 100% beneficial to the agricultural sector of Odisha.

We learned to function as a team and collaborate at our utmost best even during uncertain times.

**What's next for TECH QUAD- Odisha Centric ->**
We plan to add some more features and cover larger parts of agriculture in odisha. We also aim to make our website even more user friendly.
